    <p>Pasta and red sauce - is there a simpler staple recipe than that? Often times I'll find myself absolutely <em>craving</em> this dish but
        wishing that it was more elevated. That being said, making a delicious sauce from scratch can be time consuming. That is, until I found this recipe.
    </p>

    <p>While the whole grain pasta keeps the dish health conscious, the star of the show here is the simple yet decadent
        pasta sauce. Taking a few staple ingredients for any good pasta sauce, this recipe uses capers and artichokes to really take the flavors
        to the next level. Rest assured, the artichokes are cheap and a little goes a <em>long</em> way with the capers. I hope
        you enjoy as much as I do!
